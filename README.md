# Nebula-Writeup
My personal writeup for Nebula from Andrew Griffits Exploit Education
## https://exploit.education/nebula/

# Nebula Description: 
Nebula takes the participant through a variety of common (and less than common) weaknesses and vulnerabilities in Linux. It takes a look at

    SUID files
    Permissions
    Race conditions
    Shell meta-variables
    $PATH weaknesses
    Scripting language weaknesses
    Binary compilation failures

At the end of Nebula, the user will have a reasonably thorough understanding of local attacks against Linux systems, and a cursory look at some of the remote attacks that are possible.
